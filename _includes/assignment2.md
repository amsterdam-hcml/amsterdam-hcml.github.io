### Assignment 2: Written Report \- "Evaluation"

Deadline: November 20, 2024 EOD

**Objective:**

The goal of this assignment is to design a user study for evaluating a chosen ML application from a human-centred perspective. This will involve defining user personas, selecting appropriate evaluation methods, and considering factors like user needs, usability, and potential bias.

**Requirements:**

1. **Choose an ML Application:** Select an existing ML application for your user study. This could be a widely used system (e.g., recommender system on an e-commerce platform, chatbot customer service) or a specific application within your area of interest. Briefly describe the chosen application and its intended purpose.  
     
2. **Define User Personas:** Develop two user personas that represent the target users of the chosen ML application. Each persona should include details such as:  
     
   - Demographics (age, gender, location)  
   - Technical skills and experience with technology  
   - Goals and motivations for using the ML application (as scenarios)  
   - Potential challenges or concerns they might have with the system

   

3. **Evaluation Methods:** Propose a user study design that incorporates relevant evaluation methods to assess the human-centred aspects of the chosen ML application. Consider including at least two methods from the following:  
     
   - **Surveys:** Design a survey to gather user feedback on their experience with the ML application. This could cover aspects like ease of use, satisfaction with results, and trust in the system's outputs.  
   - **Task Completion Rates:** Outline a set of tasks that users would need to complete using the ML application. Measure the time taken and success rate for these tasks to assess usability and efficiency.  
   - **User Interviews:** Plan a series of semi-structured interviews with users to gain in-depth qualitative insights. Focus on understanding user needs, expectations, and any challenges they encounter while interacting with the ML system.  
   - **A/B Testing**: Design a setup in which you have two versions of the application which are meaningfully different in some dimension (related to human-centred perspective). Describe the versions and what measures you will use.

   

4. **Human-Centred Considerations:** In your user study design, address how you will account for the following:  
     
   - **User Needs:** Explain how your evaluation plan will assess whether the ML application effectively addresses the needs of your target users.  
   - **Usability:** Describe the methods used to evaluate the ease of use and learnability of the ML application.  
   - **Trust:** Discuss how you will measure user trust in the ML application's outputs and recommendations.  
   - **Potential Bias:** Acknowledge potential biases that might exist in the chosen ML application and outline how your user study design could uncover them.

   

5. **Deliverables:** Submit a well-structured report that includes:  
     
   - Introduction outlining the chosen ML application and user personas  
   - Detailed description of your user study design, including chosen evaluation methods and rationale  
   - Explanation of how your design addresses human-centred considerations  
   - Conclusion summarising the expected outcomes and potential value of the user study

**Requirements**:

- 1600-2000 words  
- Page limit: 4-6 pages (not counting references; mock-ups or interview guides can be included as appendices and are not counted to the page limit)  
- In ACM format: [https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow)  
- As PDF

**Grading Rubric:**

- Clarity and relevance of chosen ML application (10%)  
- Depth and detail of user personas (15%)  
- Selection and justification of evaluation methods (30%)  
- Integration of human-centred considerations (25%)  
- Overall quality and clarity of the report (20%)

**Additional Notes:**

- You are not required to conduct the actual user study for this assignment, but you should design it with sufficient detail as if you were going to implement it.  
- Consider including mock-ups of any survey questions or interview guides in your report.  
- Be mindful of ethical considerations when designing your user study. Think about how user data would be anonymised and informed consent would be obtained.
