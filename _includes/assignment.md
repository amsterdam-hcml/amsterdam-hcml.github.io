### Assignment: Panel Discussion

The panel discussions will be during the lab sessions on **November 7 and 14**. You are expected to be present for the entire lab session your group is scheduled in, not doing so may impact your grade.

Make sure to submit your discussion preparation notes (as a PDF file) on Canvas \- not submitting the notes may result in a failing grade.

**Objective:**

The aim of this assignment is to critically analyse an ML research paper from a specific human-centred perspective and participate in a panel discussion with two other groups who analyse the same paper through different lenses. You will be assigned a particular paper and lens. Note that critical does not mean 'only negative', identify what the paper does well and what positive impacts it could have.

Three possible lens (with example questions to ask yourself):
- **Data & Fairness lens**: Who is represented in the data? Who might be excluded or misrepresented? What biases might exist? Whose perspectives shaped data collection?
- **User Interaction & Deployment lens**: Who will use this system and how? Is it interpretable/explainable? Can users trust it? What happens when it fails? What expertise do users need?
- **Societal Implication lens**: Who benefits and who might be harmed? What poser dynamics does it create or reinforce? What are unintended consequences? Who isn't at the table?

To prepare for this assignment you will need to:
1. Read and critically analyse the paper
2. Identify the strengths and weaknesses of the paper (with respect to your lens)
3. Write up your **discussion preparation notes** and submit them on Canvas on the day of your assigned lab session.
    - A key part of these preparation notes will be the points you want to raise in your opening statements. 
    - These notes are expected to be 700-800 words maximum, and are meant to highlight your key take-aways from the paper.

During the discussion:
- Give your opening statements, describing the key observations through your lens (in 2-3 minutes per group)
    - Be specific, cite sections, figures, from the paper but remain concise as there is limited time. This is not a full paper presentation, you can assume the other groups have read the paper.
- Panel discussion (~20 minutes)
    - Respond to other group's observations by questioning or supporting their findings
    - Ensure everyone in the group contributes
    - You cannot "win" this discussion - the goal is to jointly understand the paper better.


**Grading Rubric:**

- Submission of discussion preparation notes (20%)
- Clarity and accuracy of group's opening statement (25%)  
- Clarity and accuracy of group's discussion contributions (25%)  
- Professionalism and Collegiality (15%)
