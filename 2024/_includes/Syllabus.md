# Course Content & Objectives

The ultimate goal of machine learning (ML) and AI is often considered to be that of building fully autonomous systems. However, every stage of building these systems involves humans, from the data, to design, and deployment. Understanding this interaction with humans, as well as the influence (both intentionally and unintentionally) that humans may have on AI systems and AI systems on humans is at the core of this course. Questions surrounding how to design and build AI systems which prioritise and adapt to human needs and preferences, as well as considerations on whose values are being encoded and what trade-offs are being made will be discussed.

This course is centred around the role of humans in all stages of ML and AI systems, including discussion of present techniques for integrating human intelligence and methods for designing systems centred on humans. Topics addressed in the course include: (inter)active learning, crowdsourcing, machine teaching, learning from human feedback, and human-centred evaluation.

- The student can understand key concepts in human-centred data work (e.g. evaluation, annotation, crowdsourcing).  
- The student can understand techniques for building systems that adapt to human feedback ((inter)active learning, RLHF, machine teaching).  
- The student can analyse a given intelligent system to identify sub-components that can be improved for humans.  
- The student can evaluate the performance of a hybrid human-AI system and identify sub-components in need of improvement.  
- The student can create a human-centred AI system that effectively solves a problem of practical consequence.

# Assessment

The assessment for this course is based on three elements: two assignments, an exam, and a final project. The final grade will be based on a weighted average of these elements, with the additional requirement that the exam and project also receive a passing grade (higher than 5.5) individually.

All assignments and the final project will be done in groups of 3 students (the group size will not be taken into account for grading in case of deviation ). In addition to the shared grade, individual contributions will be taken into account for grading.

## Assignments (30%)

### Assignment 1: Group Presentation \- "Values"

Presentations will be during the lab sessions on November 8th. You are expected to be present for the entire lab session your group is scheduled in, not doing so may impact your grade.

**Objective**: The aim of this assignment is to critically analyse an ML research paper through a human-centred lens. This exercise will involve identifying the paper's consideration of human factors, potential ethical implications, and limitations related to human interaction with the proposed ML system.

### Assignment 2: Written Report \- "Evaluation"

Deadline: November 20, 2024 EOD

**Objective**: The goal of this assignment is to design a user study for evaluating a chosen ML application from a human-centred perspective. This will involve defining user personas, selecting appropriate evaluation methods, and considering factors like user needs, usability, and potential bias.

## Exam (40%)

Mix of technical knowledge and judging/discussing human-centred aspects

## Course Project (30%)

Deadline: December 16, 2024 EOD

**Objective:**

This project challenges you to explore the practical application of human-centred ML (HCML) techniques within the context of social good initiatives. With your group you will choose a research topic related to HCML and design an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of a chosen technique on a dataset relevant to a social good problem. The focus will be on analysing the technique's performance and limitations from a human-centred perspective, considering its potential impact on social good efforts.

The grade of the project will be based on a presentation and an oral evaluation.

# Late Submission

Submissions received within 24 hours of the original deadline will at maximum be able to get 70% of the total points. Submissions received between 24 and 48 hours late will at maximum be able to receive 60% of the total grade. Submissions received between 48 hours and one week late will at maximum be able to receive 40% of the total grade. Submissions received more than one week late will receive a failing grade unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor due to extenuating circumstances.

## Generative AI and AI tools

Information and policies regarding the use of AI tools for your academic work is provided [here](https://student.uva.nl/en/topics/ai-tools-and-your-studies).

## Fraud & Plagiarism

In academia, intellectual originality is highly valued. If you copy passages from another, or claim ideas as your own without referencing the true source, it is seen as a form of intellectual theft. This rule protects the intellectual property of others, as well as your own. The program places a high emphasis on academic integrity and adheres to strict rules regarding fraud and plagiarism. Fraud and plagiarism are defined as any action or omission by a student that wholly or partly makes it impossible to accurately judge their knowledge, understanding, and skills.

If plagiarism is suspected, the instructor is obliged to inform the examination board of this suspicion. The board may then exclude students from taking exams and from performing other activities that earn study credits for a period of up to one year.

All information on what the UvA considers plagiarism and the procedures involved can be found in the regulations [Fraud and Plagiarism](https://student.uva.nl/en/topics/plagiarism-and-fraud). This regulation applies to all educational components; every student is expected to be familiar with these rules.

## Social Safety

The University of Amsterdam (UvA) is committed to fostering a positive working and study environment where interactions are respectful, no one feels unsafe, and everyone has the opportunity to develop their talents. We aim to ensure that everyone has a secure foundation for work or study, including when difficult or critical conversations are necessary. If needed, you can report inappropriate behaviour to instructors, academic advisors, the Program Director, and/or confidential advisors. For more information, the Code of Conduct, and the various services available to students, please visit the UvA's [Social Safety page](https://www.uva.nl/en/about-the-uva/about-the-university/social-safety/social-safety.html).
